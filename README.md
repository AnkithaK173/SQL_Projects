**Project Overview**
The Medical Appointment and Patient Management System is a database-driven application designed to simplify managing patient information, doctor details, appointment scheduling, and medical records. The system is built using MySQL to centralize data storage and support efficient healthcare management.

**Problem Statement**
Many healthcare facilities rely on manual or fragmented systems to manage patient data, which can result in:

I) Difficulty tracking patient medical history.
II) Inefficiencies in managing doctor availability and appointments.
III) Challenges in ensuring timely patient care.
IV) Increased administrative burden.

**Current Processes and Their Problems**
**Current Processes**
**Manual Record-Keeping**: Patient and appointment data are often stored in physical files or spreadsheets, which can lead to errors or loss of information.
**Inefficient Appointment Scheduling**: Patients face long wait times when scheduling appointments, leading to frustration.
**Lack of Data Integration**: Medical records may not be easily accessible to doctors during patient visits, hindering quality care.

**Problems**
I) Higher chances of scheduling conflicts and missed appointments.
II) Increased workload for healthcare providers.
III) Difficulty updating and accessing patient medical histories.
IV) Proposed Solution

**The proposed Medical Appointment and Patient Management System offers**:
**Centralized Database**: MySQL database to store patient data, doctor details, appointments, and medical records.
**Patient Management**: A system to manage patient information and medical histories.
**Doctor Management**: Centralized doctor details, including specialty and availability.
**Appointment Scheduling**: Streamlined appointment scheduling with real-time updates.
**Medical Records Management**: Easily accessible and up-to-date medical records for doctors and staff.

**Value Proposition**
I) **Improved Efficiency**: Reduce administrative overhead and streamline data management.
II) **Enhanced Patient Experience**: Simplify appointment scheduling and provide better access to patient data.
III) **Data Accessibility**: Facilitate real-time access to patient medical histories.
IV) **Scalability**: The system can be expanded to support additional features like telemedicine and patient portals.

**Database Structure**

**The system's database structure consists of four primary tables**:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cc0c984e-fcbd-4d83-85c1-0ce7e7d60095)


1. **Patients**:

   **Attributes**: Patient_ID, Name, Date_of_Birth, Gender, Contact_Number, Address, Medical_History
   **Primary Key**: Patient_ID

2. **Doctors**:

   **Attributes**: Doctor_ID, Name, Specialty, Contact_Number, Availability
   **Primary Key**: Doctor_ID

3. **Appointments**:

   **Attributes**: Appointment_ID, Patient_ID, Doctor_ID, Appointment_Date, Appointment_Time, Purpose, Status
   **Primary Key**: Appointment_ID
   **Foreign Keys**: Patient_ID, Doctor_ID (linked to Patients and Doctors)

4. **Medical Records**:

   **Attributes**: Record_ID, Patient_ID, Doctor_ID, Visit_Date, Diagnosis, Treatment, Notes
   **Primary Key**: Record_ID
   **Foreign Keys**: Patient_ID, Doctor_ID (linked to Patients and Doctors)

**SQL Scripts**
   Here are the SQL scripts used to create the database and the necessary tables:

   CREATE DATABASE medical_management;
USE medical_management;

CREATE TABLE Patients (
    Patient_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Date_of_Birth DATE,
    Gender CHAR(1),
    Contact_Number VARCHAR(15),
    Address VARCHAR(255),
    Medical_History TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE Doctors (
    Doctor_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    Specialty VARCHAR(100),
    Contact_Number VARCHAR(15),
    Availability ENUM('Available', 'Unavailable') DEFAULT 'Available'
);

CREATE TABLE Appointments (
    Appointment_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Patient_ID INT,
    Doctor_ID INT,
    Appointment_Date DATE,
    Appointment_Time TIME,
    Purpose VARCHAR(255),
    Status ENUM('Scheduled', 'Completed', 'Canceled') DEFAULT 'Scheduled',
    FOREIGN KEY (Patient_ID) REFERENCES Patients(Patient_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Doctor_ID) REFERENCES Doctors(Doctor_ID)
);

CREATE TABLE Medical_Records (
    Record_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    Patient_ID INT,
    Doctor_ID INT,
    Visit_Date DATE,
    Diagnosis TEXT,
    Treatment TEXT,
    Notes TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Patient_ID) REFERENCES Patients(Patient_ID),
    FOREIGN KEY (Doctor_ID) REFERENCES Doctors(Doctor_ID)
);

**Sample Data  into the database using the following SQL script**:

1. INSERT INTO Patients (Name, Date_of_Birth, Gender, Contact_Number, Address, Medical_History)
   VALUES
   ('Amit Sharma', '1990-05-21', 'M', '9876543210', '123 MG Road, Delhi', 'Asthma, Allergies');

2. INSERT INTO Doctors (Name, Specialty, Contact_Number, Availability)
   VALUES
   ('Dr. Priya Singh', 'Cardiologist', '9123456789', 'Available');

3. INSERT INTO Appointments (Patient_ID, Doctor_ID, Appointment_Date, Appointment_Time, Purpose, Status)
   VALUES
   (1, 1, '2024-10-25', '10:00:00', 'Routine Check-up', 'Scheduled');

4. INSERT INTO Medical_Records (Patient_ID, Doctor_ID, Visit_Date, Diagnosis, Treatment, Notes)
   VALUES
   (1, 1, '2024-10-01', 'Common Cold', 'Rest, Hydration, Cold medication', 'Mild symptoms, stable');

**Querying Data**
  Here are some SQL queries you can use to retrieve data from the system:

1. **List All Scheduled Appointments**
   
    SELECT A.Appointment_ID, P.Name AS Patient_Name, D.Name AS Doctor_Name, 
       A.Appointment_Date, A.Appointment_Time, A.Purpose
    FROM Appointments A
    JOIN Patients P ON A.Patient_ID = P.Patient_ID
    JOIN Doctors D ON A.Doctor_ID = D.Doctor_ID
    WHERE A.Status = 'Scheduled';
   
2. **Check Doctor Availability**

    SELECT Name, Contact_Number 
    FROM Doctors 
    WHERE Specialty = 'Cardiologist' AND Availability = 'Available';

**Frontend Integration**:

To make this project more user-friendly, you can integrate it with a web application using a frontend framework (like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or React) or a backend language like Python, PHP, or Node.js to interact with the MySQL database. This would allow doctors, patients, and admins to manage appointments and view data through a graphical interface.
