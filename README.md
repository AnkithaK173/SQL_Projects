**Project Overview**
The Medical Appointment and Patient Management System is a database-driven application designed to simplify managing patient information, doctor details, appointment scheduling, and medical records. The system is built using MySQL to centralize data storage and support efficient healthcare management.

**Problem Statement**
Many healthcare facilities rely on manual or fragmented systems to manage patient data, which can result in:

I) Difficulty tracking patient medical history.
II) Inefficiencies in managing doctor availability and appointments.
III) Challenges in ensuring timely patient care.
IV) Increased administrative burden.

**Current Processes and Their Problems**
**Current Processes**
**Manual Record-Keeping**: Patient and appointment data are often stored in physical files or spreadsheets, which can lead to errors or loss of information.
**Inefficient Appointment Scheduling**: Patients face long wait times when scheduling appointments, leading to frustration.
**Lack of Data Integration**: Medical records may not be easily accessible to doctors during patient visits, hindering quality care.

**Problems**
I) Higher chances of scheduling conflicts and missed appointments.
II) Increased workload for healthcare providers.
III) Difficulty updating and accessing patient medical histories.
IV) Proposed Solution
